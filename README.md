# Project Description

## Epoka eLearner

This project aims to create an improved learning experience for Epoka University students, based on the already existing online platforms that the university uses. Our application will offer a space where students can access all the necessary information during their studies. 

We want the students to be able to access:
* Grades 
* Attendance
* Courses
* Lectures
* Timetable
* Documents

All of them in one place. Students can also receive notifications for all of the posted lectures and they will have the possibility to post their questions for anything regarding the course and for everyone to see. This platform will also be accessible by the Epoka University staff. One of the goals is to make interaction between the students and the staff much easier since everything related to the students will be in one place.
